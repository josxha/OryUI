# Oryon - Ory User Interfaces

> This project is currently under early development.

Oryon provides user interfaces for the [Ory](https://www.ory.sh/) APIs. Ory is a 
[FOSS solution](https://www.ory.sh/open-source/) for authentication, authorization, access control, and delegation.

The Ory stack consists of the following services:
1. [Ory Kratos](https://www.ory.sh/kratos/): "Cloud native user management system. Provision IDs, store user 
information, configure authentication methods and use a headless API."
2. [Ory Hydra](https://www.ory.sh/hydra/): "OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Certified® OpenID Connect server. Cloud native, 
security-first, headless API security for your infrastructure."
3. [Ory OathKeeper](https://www.ory.sh/oathkeeper/): "Cloud native user management system. Provision IDs, store 
user information, configure authentication methods and use a headless API."
4. [Ory Keto](https://www.ory.sh/keto/): "Authorization Server inspired by Google's consistent, global 
Authorization System, providing granular access policies with RBAC, ABAC and ACL."

## Projects

### Ory Admin UI
OryAdmin is intended to be an administrative interface for the Ory services and located in the 
[/OryAdmin](/OryAdmin) directory. It is inspired by the [kratos-admin-ui](https://github.com/dfoxg/kratos-admin-ui) project.
